# "House Price Prediction in Hyderabad"
House price Prediction analysis having main feactures are Area(location), Property Type, BedRooms, Builders and prime location.
These are the main independent features for predicting price for house.

I'm going to use some main methods to do predictions are:
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling. Apply feature engineering techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct visualizations (scatter plots, histograms) and correlation analysis to identify key features.
Linear Regression with Regularization (Lasso/Ridge)
- Use regularized versions of linear regression (Lasso for feature selection, Ridge to prevent overfitting).
Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Use decision trees and random forests to model non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Use gradient boosting models such as XGBoost or LightGBM to sequentially correct errors of previous models.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Use KNN to predict house prices based on the similarity of neighboring data points.
Time Series Models (ARIMA/SARIMA)
- Use ARIMA or SARIMA models to forecast house prices based on historical price trends and seasonality.
Cross-Validation and Model Evaluation
- Use k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance and ensure generalization to unseen data.
Real-Time Data Integration
- Integrate real-time data such as market trends, interest rates, and economic indicators to adjust predictions dynamically.
